# GraphMine
An experimental server software project. DO NOT TRY TO USE THIS. This is just a proof of concept.

## What is this?
This is just yet another of SOFe's useless projects where he just writes the code and never tests it. **Do not expect a working server software from someone who doesn't even have a client.**

## So why is this here?
This software is created only to demonstrate some of my understanding of large project design patterns after years struggling with PocketMine.

No project is perfect, but I hope this one is going to *look* better than PocketMine.
